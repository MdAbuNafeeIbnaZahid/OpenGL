# OpenGL

In this project I have used openGL of C++.

I have built:

1. A colorful cube-cum-sphere. Cube can be transformed to sphere and vice versa according to input of keyboard.

2. An arrow that can move in different directions. User can control the movement using keyboard.

3. A keyboard controllable robotic arm with fingers.


This project is done as a requirement of Graphics sessional course of my undergrad.
